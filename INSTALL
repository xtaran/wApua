			  wApua Installation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

==========================================
Short installation instructions for wApua:
==========================================

Install libwww-perl (at least 5.47 or newer should work) and perl/Tk
(at least 800.019 or newer should work; version 400.xxx does not
work). Get wApua (e.g. at https://fsinfo.noone.org/~abe/wApua/) and
do

	> tar xzf wApua-latest.tar.gz
	> cd wApua-x.yz

Then configure wApua's system wide defaults by editing wApua/Config.pm
(you can always configure them in you .wApua.rc, too) and do

	> perl Makefile.PL
	> make
	> su
	# make install

Copy wApua.rc to ~/.wApua.rc and change it according to your
preferences.

==================================================
More detailed installation instructions for wApua:
==================================================

Get libwww-perl (aka LWP, at least version 5.47) from
https://metacpan.org/dist/libwww-perl

For installing libwww-perl, you'll usually also need the following
PERL modules, you'll get them from the shown URLs:

  - URI (https://metacpan.org/dist/URI)
  - HTML::Parser (https://metacpan.org/dist/HTML-Parser)
  - MIME::Base64 (https://metacpan.org/dist/MIME-Base64)
  - Net::FTP (from libnet, https://metacpan.org/dist/libnet)

Then get perl/Tk 800 (aka pTk, perl/Tk 400 will not work! Version
800.019 should be fine...). You'll get the most actual version at
https://metacpan.org/dist/Tk.

Install them all according to their installation instructions. It
should be a good idea to install libwww-perl as the last of them.

Maybe they're already installed or are available as package of your
favourite package manager.

Get the latest wApua from https://fsinfo.noone.org/~abe/wApua/ and
unpack the tar ball with

	> tar xzf wApua-latest.tar.gz

or, if no GNU tar is available, with

	> zcat wApua-latest.tar.gz | tar -xf -

Then

	> cd wApua-x.yz

where x.yz should be the version number. You may want to configure
system wide default settings for wApua by editing wApua/Config.pm
now. Then create a 'Makefile' with

	> perl Makefile.PL

and run

	> make

After that, you probably want to make some 

	> su

to gain root access and then install wApua by running

	# make install

If you don't have root access and want to install wApua locally, the
last four steps should be replaced by something like this:

	> perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=~ LIB=~/lib
	> make install

[Due to wApua not yet being at CPAN (because of lack of
 documentation), an installation using the CPAN module is not yet
 possible.]

Hope, you'll find wApua useful.

       Have fun! Axel.
