=head1 DESCRIPTION

wbmp2xbm is a converter from WAP Wireless Bitmaps (WBMP) to X Bitmaps
(XBM) written in Perl. It uses the same converting library as the WAP
WML browser wApua.

wbmp2xbm needs at least one WBMP file as argument and will save it as
XBM file with the same basename but a .xbm suffix.
