			   wApua ChangeLog
----------------------------------------------------------------------

0.06.3 to 0.06.4:

  + Support more recent DTD locations with suffix .dtd and without
    dots or underscore. Thanks to Lian Begett for the bug report!
  + Anticipatorily also support DTD locations with HTTPS.
  + Update tons of URLs in source code and documentation, switch them
    to HTTPS where possible.
  + Avoid using a specific encoding in source code.

0.06.2 to 0.06.3:

  + Support WML pages which start without XML preamble or DOCTYPE
    declaration.

0.06.1 to 0.06.2:

  + Fixed deprecation warnings with Perl 5.22 about using literal
    control characters in variable names.

0.06 to 0.06.1:

  + Fixed POD errors in wApua and wbmp2xpm
  + Minor cosmetic changes to unify comments, e-mail addresss and
    copyright statements
  + Removed trailing and leading whitespaces
  + Updated homepage and other URLs to new location

0.05.1 to 0.06:

  + Slight overhaul over nearly all files
  + Removed a lot of debug output which was printed anyway, added 
    debug flags -d and --debug. Use -d 1 for previous default 
    behaviour.
  + wApua now is more pedantic about command line options and shows a 
    short help if called with -h, --help or --usage. Same for
    wbmp2xbm.pl.
  + wApua now optionally (see example config) inserts a line break
    after each link, like the Nokia 6210 does.
  + Small modifications to Makefile.PL including 'make emacs' support
    ;-)
  + Small cosmetic modifications to README and INSTALL
  + DOCTYPE string parsing now knows more valid variations.
  + Ability to show loaded perl libraries
  + Bugfix: "view source" works again
  + Renaming wbmp2xbm.pl to wbmp2xbm
  + Clean initialisation of debug flag in wApua::WBMP2XBM
  + Input sanitizing, --debug and --verbose flag for wbmp2xbm
  + POD documentation

0.05dev to 0.05.1:

  + Compatibiliy with newer Tk versions, especially 804.027 and above
  + Documentation bugfix for how to install it locally
  + Address change in the license

0.04dev to 0.05dev:

  + wApua now reads config files on startup and has much more
    configuration possibilities. For this reason also some default
    values have changed (Home page, HTTP Accept-Languages header, etc.).
  + Added a simple authentication dialog.
  + Added a simple phone URL decoder.
  + Added a right-click popup menu, which needs no further mouse
    movement to activate the history back function
  + Added a stop button. 
  + Added (WBMP based) bitmap navigation buttons. (The old text
    navigation buttons are still available, just say "TextButtons:
    true" in your ~/.wApua.rc
  + If appropriate, the status bar shows number of cards in the actual
    deck or image dimensions.
  + Different HTTP Accept headers for images and other files.
  + wApua now uses the xml_mode feature of HTML::Parser. So since now
    at least HTML::Parser 3.00 (more precisely 2.99_06  :-) is necessary.
  + Added again more informations (mostly used module versions) to the
    internal page "about:#info"
  + Added the wApua logo to the main "about:#index" page.
  + The User-Agent header now conatins more information:
    - wApua version (now with "/" instead of " " as delimiter)
    - PERL version
    - libwww-perl version
    - perl/Tk version
    - Value of $^O
  + wApua::UserAgent now is a specialization of LWP::UserAgent
  + Added the wApua logo in the lower right corner of the browser
    window. A click on the logo gets you to the wApua home page.
  + Fixed some minor bugs:
    - Local images (URLs with file:/) are no more cached.
    - Fixed compilation problems under PERL versions lesser than
      5.006.
    - Several bugs concerning history and/or forward/back buttons.
    - Links in tables now set the cursor right.
  + Improved "busy state".
  + Improved (re-)initialising of the "do buttons".
  + History-Back and -Forward functions now ring a bell, if they're
    invoked (e.g. via key bindings) and a history movement in that
    direction isn't possible.
  + Main and history menu now write something into the state line.
  + Some code clean up/improvements.
  + MainWindow is coming up much earlier now.
  + Fixed again some more bugs in key bindings.
  + Updated a lot in the README file.
 
0.03dev to 0.04dev:

  + Changed the name from "wApua.pl" to "wApua".
  + Added a RAM cache.
  + Added the internal page "about:#cache", which shows which pages
    are cached. It is also accessible via menu.
  + Comfortable installation via MakeMaker
  + Added a key bindings help page called "about:#keys", which replaced
    "about:#index" in the menu.
  + Fixed again some more bugs in key bindings.
  + Improved WBMP support:
    - Error messages are shown in the browser if some image file
      doesn't exist or isn't a supported WBMP file.
    - The image dimension is shown, when the mouse is over some WBMP
      image.
  + Several minor bug fixes:
    - When loading some WML page with inline WBMPs, now the deck size
      (shown in the status line) is really the deck size and not the
      size of the last image loaded, as before.
    - Entities in labels of do-buttons are no more ignored.
    - Removed wrong data description in about:#info
    - The text cursor doesn't appear anymore in the text window.
    - The cursor in text window now displays the right cursor, also if
      some link was highlighted in the meantime. It also has now the
      $textcursor initially instead of $normalcursor.
    - After hitting enter in the location field, the focus goes back
      to the text window.
  + Changed the default size from 420x260 to 420x360
  + Improved internal pages "about:#info" and "about:#env" (now using
    tables)
  + Some performance improvements
  + Added an INSTALL file

0.02dev to 0.03dev:

  + Some minor bugfixes on doctype string parsing and menus
  + Added WBMP (Type 0) support and an WBMP to XBM converter for
    command line use

  + Added "Show source" function.
  + Fixed some more bugs in key bindings

0.01dev to 0.02dev:

  + Added proxy support via environment variables
